# Avatar Placeholder

This directory contains the avatar image for the blog. 

For now, we're using a placeholder. You can replace `avatar.png` with your actual profile picture later.

To add your avatar:
1. Add a square image (recommended: 512x512px) named `avatar.png` in this directory
2. Or update the `avatar` setting in `_config.yml` to point to your image URL
